>I often hear engineers telling me “**they are not good at web-design**” because “**they are not artists**”.

And they're right, if you work in a fancy web agency making fancy websites, you need some kind of artistic sensitivity.

But working on a functional web-app like *Airbnb*, *Facebook*, *Product Hunt*, has nothing to do with art, it’s about respecting patterns and simple graphical rules, and mainly stealing others work.

*So here is some efficient rules to have good looking website without reading any design book*:



## 1. Don't play with fancy colours

If you’re not born a designer, just use the '*gray scale*' and bring colour with small touches. That’s exactly what [Medium](https://medium.com/) does, using mostly gray values and a nice flashy green in very light touch.

## 2. Space matters as much as objects

The space that surrounds an object (text, image, etc..) is as important as the object itself. It creates boundaries and helps identify the different zones on the screen.

## 3. Our eyes need contrast

We can’t differentiate between contents without contrast. If everything look the same, then we don’t know where to look. We need graphical guidance. Here is an obvious example of contrast between a main title and a secondary one.

**“Same size” is not “same proportion”**

It’s not because images have the same width and height in terms of pixels that they have harmonious proportions.

## 4. Backgrounds need filters and effect

When images are too contrasted, you need to put a filter on top of them to make your texts readable.

**Separation of concerns**

>In computer, **separation of concerns** (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. — Wikipedia

*SoC* also applies very well to design. Let’s imagine you want to make an image rounded with a red border. For that you can write this “design task” and give it a name, like:

*Rounded-with-red-border:* border is red + corners are rounded
But you can also separate those two tasks under two different names:

*Rounded:* corners are rounded

*Red-bordered:* border is red
The second option is much better since you separate elementary design tasks. Then you can either combine them or use them independently. Separation of concerns is not just for software and backend. It also applies very well to design.

**The end**

I hope this article will offer interesting and useful insights to *developer* who think they’re not designers or designers who want to structure their approach.
